description: Hyperledger Besu high availability
// - END of page meta data

= High availability of JSON-RPC and RPC Pub/Sub APIs

To enable high availability to the xref:../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.adoc[RPC Pub/Sub API over WebSockets] or the xref:../../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.adoc[JSON-RPC API], run and synchronize multiple Hyperledger Besu nodes to the network.
Use a load balancer to distribute requests across nodes in the cluster that are ready to receive requests.

important

 We do not recommend putting [bootnodes](../../Deploy/Bootnodes.md) behind a load balancer.

== Determining when a node is ready

Use the link:../../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md#readiness-and-liveness-endpoints[readiness endpoint] to determine when a node is ready.

!!!
note

 The minimum number of peers and number of blocks from the best known block for determining if a
 node considered ready is deployment specific.

== Transaction nonces

Besu obtains the nonce for the next transaction using link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount[`eth_getTransactionCount`].
The nonce depends on the transactions in the xref:../../../Concepts/Transactions/Transaction-Pool.adoc[transaction pool].
If sending link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount[`eth_getTransactionCount`] and link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_sendrawtransaction[`eth_sendRawTransaction`] requests for a specific account to multiple nodes, the link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount[`eth_getTransactionCount`] results might be incorrect.

!!!
note

 If using [private transactions](../../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview.md), retrieve the
 nonce using
 [`priv_getTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_gettransactioncount) or
 [`priv_getEeaTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_geteeatransactioncount)
 and send the private transactions using
 [`eea_sendRawTransaction`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eea_sendrawtransaction).

To get correct nonces when distributing requests across a cluster, either:

* Track the next nonce outside of the Besu node (as MetaMask does)
* Configure the load balancer in sticky mode to send requests from a specific account to a single node, unless that node is unavailable.

== Subscriptions

You can subscribe to events using:

* xref:../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.adoc[RPC Pub/Sub over WebSockets]
* xref:../../Interact/Filters/Accessing-Logs-Using-JSON-RPC.adoc[Filters over HTTP].

We recommend using xref:../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.adoc[RPC Pub/Sub over WebSockets] because WebSockets connections associate with a specific node and do not require using the load balancer in sticky mode.

If using xref:../../Interact/Filters/Accessing-Logs-Using-JSON-RPC.adoc[filters over HTTP], configure the load balancer in sticky mode to associate the subscription with a specific node.

== Recovering from dropped subscriptions

Dropped subscriptions can occur because of:

* A disconnected WebSockets connection
* The removal of the node serving the subscription from the ready pool.

If there is a dropped subscription, missed events might occur while reconnecting to a different node.
To recover dropped messages, create another subscription and follow the process for that link:../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md#subscribing[subscription type]:

* <<new-headers,`newHeads`>>
* <<logs,`logs`>>
* <<new-pending-transactions,`newPendingTransactions`>>
* <<dropped-pending-transactions,`droppedPendingTransactions`>>
* <<syncing,`syncing`>>.

=== New headers

To request information on blocks from the last block before the subscription dropped to the first block received from the new subscription, use link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_getblockbynumber[`eth_getBlockByNumber`].

=== Logs

To request logs from the block number of the last log received before the subscription dropped to the current chain head, use link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_getlogs[`eth_getLogs`].

=== New pending transactions

To request all pending transactions for the new node, use link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#txpool_besutransactions[`txpool_besuTransactions`].

!!!
note

 Nodes do not all store the same pending transactions.

=== Dropped pending transactions

To request all pending transactions for the new node, use link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#txpool_besutransactions[`txpool_besuTransactions`].

!!!
note

 Nodes do not all store the same pending transactions.

=== Syncing

The syncing state of each node is specific to that node.
To retrieve the syncing state of the new node, use link:../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_syncing[`eth_syncing`].
