:description: Using Elastick Stack (ELK) with Hyperledger Besu

Elastic Stack (also known as ELK) is a common open-source log management platform.

https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-sample-networks[Besu Sample Networks] provides example implementations using Elastic Stack for log management.

The https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-sample-networks/blob/master/filebeat/filebeat.yml[Filebeat configuration] ingests the logs and outputs them to Redis for storage.
Redis provides a highly available mechanism enabling log storage by any of the Elastic Beats and pulled by Logstash as required.

The https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-sample-networks/blob/master/logstash/pipeline/20_besu.conf[pipeline configuration] defines the JSON format used for Besu logs and automatically picks up any new log fields.

!!!
note     The pipeline configuration must match the your log format.
If using the default, you can use     the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html[grok plugin]     to extract the log fields.

To see the Besu Sample Networks logs in Kibana:

. Open the http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/discover[`Kibana logs address`] listed by the sample networks `list.sh` script.
The logs display in Kibana.
