= Install the developer portal

== Clone

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:Redocly/developer-portal-starter.git

cd developer-portal-starter
----

== Install dependencies

Before you start...
you'll need node and yarn installed.

* https://nodejs.org/en/[node.js >= 10.15.1]
* https://yarnpkg.com/en/[yarn]

[source,bash]
----
yarn install
----

Depending on your operating system, you may see warnings when installing dependencies.

== Start the development environment

[source,bash]
----
yarn start
----

This command will start a development server.
Most functionality exists in the development server except for search.
When the server is ready, the url will be published to the console.
It may default to http://localhost:3000.
Open that in a browser to see this developer portal load.

== Stop the development environment

Press control and c.

== Clearing cache

Troubleshooting?
Try this out.

A few changes (such as changing the key of a sidebar definition) require clearing cache to reflect in the local server.
We actively reduce these to make the best development environment experience possible.

. Press control-c.
. Run `yarn clean` in the command prompt to clear the cache.
. Run `yarn start` again.
